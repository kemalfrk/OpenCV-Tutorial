# OpenCV Tutorial - Gazi University

In this tutorial, we will explore the basics and advanced applications of the OpenCV library for computer vision. Topics include image processing, video analysis, shape and text operations, image merging, gradients, morphological operations, thresholding methods, object detection with HAAR Cascade models, contour operations, and real-world examples. This two-day workshop combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on projects. By the end, participants will gain the skills to develop computer vision projects using Python and OpenCV.
